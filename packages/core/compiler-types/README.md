# Noodles UI / Core / Compiler Types

> Types to support the design system build tools

Early days. See [root README](../../../README.md) for an introduction.

## Concern

Provide core domain types consistently across all systems.

Some runtime code, such as [@noodles-ui/core-services](../types/README.md), reference types such as `Themes`, `ColourSchemeName`, or `Surface`.

Compiler types are consumed in:

- compiler code, such as [@noodles-ui/lib-tools](../../support/lib-tools/README.md)
- compiler UI code, such as [@noodles-ui/live-app](../../support/live-app/README.md)
