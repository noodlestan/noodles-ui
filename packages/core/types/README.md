# Noodles UI / Core / Types

> Noodles UI core domain types

Early days. See [root README](../../../README.md) for an introduction.

## Concern

Provide core domain types consistently across all systems.

Runtime code, such as [@noodles-ui/solidjs-services](../../solidjs/services//README.md), reference types such as `Themes`, `ColourSchemeName`,`Surface`, and `TokenMap`.
