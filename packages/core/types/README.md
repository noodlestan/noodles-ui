# Noodles UI / Core / Types

> Types for modeling design systems

Early days. See [root README](../../../README.md) for an introduction.

## Concern

Provide core domain types consistently across all systems.

Some runtime code, such as [@noodles-ui/core-services](../types/README.md), reference types such as `Themes`, `ColourSchemeName`, or `Surface`.

### Primitive types

Primitives that are shared by both run-time code and tooling code

Examples: `TokenMap` and `ColourSchemeName`
