## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

```bash
npm run build
```

You can execute the server by running

```bash
npm run start
```

Refer to [Deploying your SolidJS App](https://docs.solidjs.com/guides/deploying-your-app) for detailed setup instructions.
