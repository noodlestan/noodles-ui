# Noodles UI

> Tokens first UI library framework
>
> ~ \o/ early days \o/ ~

**Goals:**

- Support the creation and management of large, complex, and/or many design system UI libraries
- Build quickly on top of high quality headless components and primitives (Kobalte, Ark UI, and Noodles own catalogue)
- Use a tokens first approach to all things design, style, themes, code, and tools
- Auto generate high performance and platform specific code, while preserving the ability to extend it
- Supreme authoring experience for developers, designers, and documentation authors alike
- (Maybe) Support SSG, SSR and native targets (eventually via different transforms)
- (Maybe) Support different frameworks (React, Vue, SolidJS, Angular)

- [SolidStart](./packages/sandbox/app-solidstart/README.md) - Noodles UI sandbox built with SolidStart (SSG)

### Docs

- [Docs](./packages/support/docs/README.md) - Noodles UI website

## Development

Recommended software:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) (see [.nvmrc](./.nvmrc) for which version, use [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install it)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) \+ VS Code Plugins:
  - [ESlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)
  - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
  - [Spell Right](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright)

### Committing

[Lefthook](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/lefthook-knock-your-teams-code-back-into-shape) should run automatically before every commit.

- lints all code
- does a global `tsc` compilation
- builds the base library
- builds the styled libraries
- builds the docs app

**Note:** if you encounter `ðŸ¥Š lint` errors you should run `npm run lint` for details (linting is silent because `prettier` is noisy and breaks Lefthook's output buffering)
